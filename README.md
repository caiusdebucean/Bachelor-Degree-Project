# Bachelor-Degree-Project
This is my UPT Bachelor's Degree final project, called **YOVO: You Only Voxelize Once**, concerning 3D image reconstruction from 2D single images. 
My current Degree-Project mentor is Dr. Eng. Conf. Calin-Adrian Popa.


The new method is called YOVO: You Only Voxelize Once. It is inspired by [Pix2Vox](https://github.com/hzxie/Pix2Vox) and reinvents the Auto-encoder module, having multi-level feature extracting, leading to multiple volumes extracted from the same image. Moreover, using Mish activations, Dropblock regularization, RANGER optimizer and MobileNet V2 as backbone, YOVO overcomes the current SotA on Data3D-R2N2.

The model can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17-BY7uKjhebzNxps9hAFU1WNc35JSt3o).

More documentation is coming soon, as the project is still in development and alternative techniques remain to be explored.


This repository is for scientific purposes only and it contains my trial of pushing the results to a new SotA and testing various methods.
