# Bachelor-Degree-Project
My UPT Bachelor's Degree final project concerning 3D image reconstruction from 2D single/multimple images.
My current Degree-Project mentor is Dr. Eng. Conf. Calin-Adrian Popa.

All current work is based on the SotA on ShapeNet which is Pix2Vox
  * https://github.com/hzxie/Pix2Vox
Alternative research is being made.

This repository is for scientific purposes only and it contains my trial of pushing the results to a new SotA.
