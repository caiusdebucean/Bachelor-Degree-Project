In this folder I will keep track of my code modifications.

    1. 'Pix2Vox/utils/binvox_visualization.py' - Commented line 19 as matplotlib doesn't allow it anymore
    2. 'Pix2Vox/core/test.py' - Added output directory and TensorboardX write compatibility for image results from net and gt - line 39 
    3.  OPTIONAL : 'Pix2Vox/core/test.py' - Removed the 3 samples images output limit - line 155
    4. 'Pix2Vox/core/test.py' - Transposed rendering_views variable twice, as the supported type for TensorboardX is (C x W x H) and the one present was (W x H x C) - line 161
    5. 'Pix2Vox/utils/binvox_visualization.py' - Added idx parameter to function to pass it to the save function for every test image, as the previous save function was overwriting output photos - line 22
