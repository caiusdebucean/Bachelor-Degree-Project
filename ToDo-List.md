This is a file tracking the of improvements and modifications I want to add to the current state of Pix2Vox or other projects/topics I come across. 
_Minor changes, such as code modifications or small improvements will not be tracked in this document_

General improvement *ideas*:
* Try out different optimizers
* Try different backbone architecture (HR-Net, SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, ResNet, etc.)
* Study what modules can be improved
* Try out and research personal super secret activation function
* Try out different augmentation and regularization methods
* Research photogrammetry (from DL research or apps like canvas.io or occipital projects)
* Research PapersWithCode for similar tasks

Specific things *to do* in the future:
* Implement RANGER optimizer
* Implement HR-Net or U-net alternative for backbone
* Add regularization method DropBlock
* Try out Pix2Vox-F

Things which I have *done*:
* Corrected Pix2Vox-A and made it *Work*
